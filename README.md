# NexXplorer

An application for the [futurist](https://github.com/ftrst/futurist-react) framework.

This app receives information from a server-side proxy that renders the HTML for a given web page, they displays it within the app.

It is more of an example that "works", but certainly can be refined.

## Installing the App
As with all Futurist Apps, this repo can be run isolated from the framework.

To install the App, review the installation guide here: https://docs.futurist.io/framework/app_walkthrough/

## Try It Out!

NetXplorer (nxp) can be utilized as a standalone [Application](https://docs.futurist.io/framework/architecture/), without any reliance on the rest of the futurist framework.

This is by design, to allow anyone to try before installing it into the larger project, should they choose to do so.

Treat it as you would any other React project:

1) Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ftrst/ftrst-netxplorer
```

2) Install the packages:
```
npm install
```

3) Run the project:
```
npm dev
```
